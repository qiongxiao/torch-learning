# NN-Learning

## Introduction

This is torch7 code for my study of nn.

Here are some greate code sources:

> [torch-rnn by jcjohnson](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn)

## Library

### Mnist

Basic torch code for classifying MNIST dataset using LeNet. The code organization follows [torch-rnn by jcjohnson](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn)

**NOTE**: not recommend

### Cifar

Basic torch code for classifying Cifar10 dataset using VGGnet. The code organization follows [torch-rnn by jcjohnson](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn)

**NOTE**: not recommend

### Image

Basic torch code for different datasets using different model types. The code organization follows (some codes are copied from) [torch-resnet by facebook](https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch)

| Dataset		| Model						|
| ------------- |:-------------:			|
| mnist			| lenet						|
| cifar10		| lenet, vggnet, resnet		|
| cifar100		| lenet, vggnet, resnet		|
| imagenet		| lenet, vggnet, resnet		|

**NOTE**:

	1. please read the options when running

### NeuralTalk

Basic torch code for lstm used for image captioning.

**NOTE**:

	1. still working on it
